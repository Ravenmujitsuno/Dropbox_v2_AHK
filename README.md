# Dropbox_v2_AHK
Integration of the Dropbox API v2 with Autohotkey (AHK)

Unfortunately, there is no implemention of the new Dropbox API in Autohotkey (AHK_L). Therefor I started to read the old APIs (where there allready is a repository) and tried to fiddle out the new APIs.

Feel free to comment on improvements, since I am pretty new to AHK and Github.
